# test-rewards
A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.
 
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every
dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.
(e.g., a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
 

Given a record of every transaction during a three-month period, calculate the reward points earned for
each customer per month and total.
